    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Shirley's Mini Pies</h1>

    <p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 150px;">

    Shirley's favourite hobby is baking, and we see this in arguably the best episode in Community's history: 'Remedial Chaos Theory',
    featuring in Season 3 Episode 4. In the first and third timelines, her pies are succesfully baked. However, in the second timeline,
    the group lets her pies burn because they believe she has a baking addiction. Nonetheless, these are absolutely delicious pies that
    Shirley cooks with her heart. Lets see how it is made!
