    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Abed's Buttered Noodles</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 150px;">
        This is Abed's favourite food. He absolutely loves buttered Noodles
        and can eat it every day of the week. He first mentions Buttered noodles in
        Season 3 of the show. He even gets a box of 24 packets of buttered noodles for his 
        birthday from Shirley. We will see how he makes his buttered noodles below.
